I am currently an IT analyst at DATAPREV. In 2017, I begin to study the Masters in Computer Science by the State University of Cear√° in the area of Software Engineering. I obtained my Bachelor's Degree in Information Systems from Christus University Center in 2010.

Currently I am mainly researching Microservices.
