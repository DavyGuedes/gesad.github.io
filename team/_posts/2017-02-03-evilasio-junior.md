I am a graduate student at the University of Washington, where I am pursuing a joint MS in Epidemiology and PhD in Molecular and Cell Biology. Generally, I am interested in questions about how viruses evolve and interact with their hosts. What allows a virus to infect a new host species? How do viruses adapt to their hosts and evade the immune system? Previous work on SIV cross-species transmission dynamics; current work on dengue virus antigenic evolution.
